    "\n",
    "The Viterbi algorithm solves the following problem: given an observed sequence $x_1,...x_T$, what is the most probable sequence of hidden states $z_1,...,z_T$ that is associated with it?\n",

    "The Viterbi algorithm is an example of dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the Viterbi algorithm is not the forward algorithm, it works somehow *similar* to it, but with a different quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we are trying to find is $$z^* \\equiv \\text{argmax}_{z}\\ p(z| x)\\,, $$ where, here, $z$ and $x$ represent, loosely, the entire sequences of hidden and observed states, respectively. Note that $ p(z|x) = \\frac{p(z,x)}{p(x)}$ and hence, since $p(x)$ does not depend on $z$, we have that $$ z^* = \\text{argmax}_{z}\\ p(z,x)$$"
